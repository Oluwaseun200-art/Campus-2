# Campus Transportation Routing System

A lightweight web-based academic prototype for finding a route between selected University of Ibadan campus locations.

## Technologies
- HTML5: page structure
- CSS3: styling and responsive layout
- JavaScript: validation and route calculation
- Dijkstra-style shortest-path search: selects the lowest-distance path in the stored sample network

```

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The app uses local JavaScript files and does not require a backend server.

## Publish with GitHub Pages
1. Upload the contents of this folder to the root of your GitHub repository (not the ZIP file itself).
2. Keep `index.html` at the repository root.
3. Keep `css/styles.css`, `js/app.js`, and `data/locations.js` at the exact paths shown above.
4. In the repository, open **Settings → Pages**.
5. Under the build/deployment source, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select the branch containing your files (often `main`) and choose **/(root)**, then save.
6. Wait for deployment and open the published site.

## Important limitations
The included locations and distances are illustrative sample data, not verified official University of Ibadan route measurements. Replace them with verified campus data before relying on the results for real travel. The prototype does not provide live GPS tracking, real-time traffic, vehicle tracking, ticketing or live transport schedules. The displayed walking time is a rough estimate based on distance.

## Suggested tests
- Choose two different locations and confirm that a route is displayed.
- Choose the same location for both fields and confirm a validation message appears.
- Submit with one or both fields empty and confirm a validation message appears.
- Try several origin/destination pairs and check the ordered stops.
- Test the page on both phone and desktop widths.
